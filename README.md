# Email-bot
The bot is designed to send customers an e-mail asking them to complete surveys, but it can easily be transformed in order to provide different functionalities.
Each client has an individual and unique link to the survey. Client's sex, name, surname, email adress and the link to the survey should be prepared in an .xlsx file.
The data should have at least the fields shown in the file **mailing_data.xlsx**.
