# Email-bot
## Specification
The bot is designed to send customers an emails asking them to complete surveys, but it can easily be transformed in order to provide different functionalities.
In this version of the code each client has a unique link to the survey. Each client's sex, name, surname, email adress and the link to the survey should be prepared in an .xlsx, .xls or .csv file. The data should include at least the fields shown in the file **mailing_data.xlsx**. Columns must have the same names but they don't need to be in the same order, and there can be some additional columns.
## Email account settings
In order to use a Gmail account use as the senderâ€™s address it is necessary to lower the security standards of the account from which we wish to send the emails.
It can be easily done under the link below:\

You just need to click **enable access for less secure applications**.
Unfortunately it is necessary, because most of the email services protect themselves from unauthorised programs. A possible solution could be encrypting the connection, but it was not implemented nor verified.

- **mailing_bot.py** program file
- gender-specific message content in **message_f.txt**, **message_m.txt** files (content can be changed but the names of the files must remain the same)
